# Content Management API

A Node.js Express API for managing content links across user-defined spaces with authentication.





## API architecture 

```
//auth routes
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/login

//brainly CRUD
GET /api/v1/content -> view all link 
POST /api/v1/content -> create a link
DELETE /api/v1/content/:id -> delete card by ID

//spaces
GET /api/v1/space -> get all spaces
POST /api/v1/space -> create a space
GET /api/v1/space/startup -> all the links in startup space
DELETE /api/v1/space/:id -> delete space by id

```

## Project Status: Archived

This project was developed as a learning exercise for building RESTful APIs with Express, authentication flows, and basic content management. It is no longer under active development.

## Features

- User authentication (register/login) with JWT
- Content spaces management
- Link scraping and metadata extraction
- Basic caching middleware

## Technical Overview

The project is built with:
- Express.js
- Drizzle ORM
- JWT for authentication
- Zod for schema validation
- Transaction-based database operations

## Architecture Limitations

While functional, this project has several architectural limitations that would need addressing before production use:

### Authentication & Security
- Basic JWT implementation without token revocation
- Limited error handling and security hardening
- No rate limiting or brute force protection

### Distributed Systems Considerations
- Simplistic caching without proper invalidation strategy
- No consideration for horizontal scaling
- Limited resilience patterns for handling downstream failures
- No backpressure mechanisms for handling load spikes

### Data Management
- Hard-coded query limits (100 records)
- Transactions without specified isolation levels
- Potential race conditions in concurrent operations

## Potential Improvements

1. **Authentication Enhancements**:
   - Implement token refresh flow
   - Add proper session management
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Implement proper retry mechanisms
   - Enhance error handling and logging

3. **Scaling Considerations**:
   - Implement proper cache invalidation
   - Consider message queues for asynchronous operations
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Design for stateless horizontal scaling

## Learning Takeaways

This project demonstrates:
- Basic Express routing patterns
- Authentication flows with JWT
- Data validation with Zod
- Transaction handling in a web API

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundation for understanding API development patterns but would require significant architectural enhancements to be production-ready for scaled use. It's best used as a reference or starting point rather than a production system.
